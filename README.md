# 🌾 High-Throughput Phenotyping (HTP) for Nitrogen Use Efficiency in Rice – IARI

## 📘 Introduction

This repository contains the custom R scripts used in the postprocessing of high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) image data for nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) analysis in rice.

Postprocessing of image data was conducted using custom software written in the R programming language ([https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/);). The dataset analyzed, resulting metrics, and full processing pipeline are provided here to ensure reproducibility and transparency.

The entire image analysis workflow—including REML-based trait modeling, PCA, clustering, MGIDI computation, GWAS visualization, and trait dynamics—is organized as modular R scripts for easy adaptation to other crops and datasets.
