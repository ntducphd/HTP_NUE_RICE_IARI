We present a phenomics-driven approach to identify rice genotypes with superior nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), integrating high-throughput image-based phenotyping, trait dissection, multivariate selection indices, and genome-wide association analysis (GWAS).  

The provided R scripts cover all stages of analysis â€” from image-derived trait modeling (biomass, greenness, dynamics) to genetic diversity, selection indices (MGIDI), clustering, and GWAS. This reproducible pipeline supports phenomics-assisted breeding for sustainable agriculture.
